title:	"ppc64le on x86_64: QEMU full-system emulation"
date:	2018-01-31
---

You can run a `ppc64le` virtual machine on your `x86_64` computer with QEMU full-system emulation!

This provides an environment that is very similar to an original system,
although with slower performance due to processor instruction emulation.

It can be handy to run programs that are not processor intensive, and
help a bit in growing your patience.

## QEMU

Let's build the QEMU target for full-system emulation of the `ppc64le` architecture (`ppc64-softmmu`).

Download (for example, a stable release):

```
$ wget https://download.qemu.org/qemu-2.11.0.tar.xz
$ tar xf qemu-2.11.0.tar.xz 
$ cd qemu-2.11.0
```

Build:

```
$ ./configure --target-list=ppc64-softmmu
...
host CPU          x86_64
host big endian   no
target list       ppc64-softmmu
...

$ make -j$(nproc)
...
  LINK    ppc64-softmmu/qemu-system-ppc64
```

Run:

```
$ cp ppc64-softmmu/qemu-system-ppc64 ~/bin

$ qemu-system-ppc64 --version
QEMU emulator version 2.11.0

## QEMU machines

QEMU provides a number of _machine_ types for PowerPC (for the various PowerPC _platforms_).

The `ppc64le` architecture currently runs on 2 platforms:

 - `pseries`: the virtualized environment traditionally provided by the PowerVM hypervisor
    for LPARs (logical partitions -- virtual machines), and later introduced in QEMU for
    KVM guests.

 - `powernv`: the non-virtualized (`nv`) environment provided by the OPAL firmware, to run
    without a hypervisor and/or as a hypervisor (KVM host), also known as _bare-metal_ mode.  
    (note: _originally_ non-virtualized, more recently introduced in QEMU; so sort of  _virtualized_ here :-)

The QEMU machines for those are:

```
$ qemu-system-ppc64 -machine help
Supported machines are:
...
powernv              IBM PowerNV (Non-Virtualized)
...
pseries              pSeries Logical Partition (PAPR compliant) (alias of pseries-2.11)
...
```

## QEMU processors

Similarly, QEMU provides a number of _processor_ types for PowerPC.

The `ppc64le` architecture currently runs on PowerPC _server_-class processors,
also known as "POWER" processors (originally manufactured by IBM), on POWER8 and later.

The QEMU processors range from POWER5+ to POWER9, currently:

```
$ qemu-system-ppc64 -cpu help | grep power[0-9] | grep alias
PowerPC power5+          (alias for power5+_v2.1)
PowerPC power5gs         (alias for power5+_v2.1)
PowerPC power7           (alias for power7_v2.3)
PowerPC power7+          (alias for power7+_v2.1)
PowerPC power8e          (alias for power8e_v2.1)
PowerPC power8nvl        (alias for power8nvl_v1.0)
PowerPC power8           (alias for power8_v2.0)
PowerPC power9           (alias for power9_v2.0)
```

## QEMU files and options for PowerPC platforms

The QEMU machine for the `pseries` platform requires 2 files:

 - `spapr-rtas.bin`:
    _Server_ POWER Architecture Platform Requirements -
    [Run-Time Abstraction Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-Time_Abstraction_Services)  
    (otherwise, `qemu-system-ppc64: Could not find LPAR rtas 'spapr-rtas.bin'`)

 - `slof.bin`:
    [Slimline](https://www.openfirmware.info/SLOF)
    [Open Firmware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Firmware)  
    (otherwise, `qemu-system-ppc64: Could not find LPAR firmware 'slof.bin'`)

Both files ship with QEMU, and should be automatically installed at the right places with `make install`.

However, for our local QEMU binary (for testing purposes) that is not done, so copy the files to the
current directory when QEMU runs:

```
$ cp qemu-2.11.0/pc-bios/spapr-rtas.bin .
$ cp qemu-2.11.0/pc-bios/slof.bin .
```

_UPDATE (2018-03-17)_: another option is to configure the QEMU build with the `--firmwarepath` option,
and copy the files over there; in this example:

```
$ ./configure --target-list=ppc64-softmmu --firmwarepath=$HOME/bin # don't use '~'
...
firmware path     /home/mfoliveira/bin
...

$ make -j$(nproc)
...
  LINK    ppc64-softmmu/qemu-system-ppc64

$ cp ppc64-softmmu/qemu-system-ppc64 \
     pc-bios/spapr-rtas.bin \
     pc-bios/slof.bin \
     ~/bin
```


And these QEMU options allow you to run without a couple of other files:

 - `-nodefaults`  
    (otherwise, `qemu-system-ppc64: Initialization of device VGA failed: failed to find romfile "vgabios-stdvga.bin"`)

 - `-nographic`  
    (otherwise, `Could not read keymap file: 'en-us'`)

## QEMU command line

Finally, this QEMU command line is good for starters: `pseries` platform, `power8` processor,
and text console on terminal (tip: do not press `ctrl-c` for now :-) 

```
$ qemu-system-ppc64 \
    -machine pseries \
    -cpu power8 \
    -nodefaults \
    -nographic \
    -serial stdio
```

## Alpine Linux

Now, let's test that with something real, _Alpine Linux_.

Download:
```
$ wget http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.7/releases/ppc64le/alpine-vanilla-3.7.0-ppc64le.iso
```

Run:
```
$ qemu-system-ppc64 \
    -machine pseries \
    -cpu power8 \
    -nodefaults \
    -nographic \
    -serial stdio \
    -cdrom alpine-vanilla-3.7.0-ppc64le.iso
```

And you can (slowly) watch SLOF load, populate the PowerPC device tree with
the devices emulated by QEMU, search for boot devices, and boot one.

      Use the ^ and v keys to select which entry is highlighted.          
      Press enter to boot the selected OS, `e' to edit the commands       
      before booting or `c' for a command-line.
```

You can edit the boot entry to remove the `quiet` option to watch the kernel
booting in more detail (as that is a bit slow); press `ctrl-x` to boot.

Yeehaw!

It's indeed a bit slow, as that is full-system emulation, but it can very well
be used to run programs which are not processor intensive, just like the
ones to learn and practice the basics about `ppc64le`. ;-)
